# DDEV config for node projects

This is a boilerplate for a simple ddev config that will serve well for quickly spinning up node projects that don't need a database.

## Why DDEV?

By using ddev we can containerize our projects and version control node eaisily without having to install anything else on our machine except for docker and ddev.
